The Bank Fraud Detection System is a machine learning–based project designed to identify fraudulent financial transactions in real time. With the rapid growth of digital banking, online payments, and UPI transactions, financial fraud has become a major concern for banks and customers. 
The Bank Fraud Detection System is a Machine Learning–based project designed to identify fraudulent financial transactions in banking systems. With the rapid growth of digital payments and online banking, fraud detection has become a critical requirement for financial institutions to minimize financial losses and protect customers.
This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost to analyze transaction data and classify whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent. The model is trained on a dataset containing transaction-related features such as transaction amount, transaction time, account information, and transaction type.
The workflow of the project includes:
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Handling missing values and class imbalance
Feature selection and transformation
Model training and evaluation
Performance measurement using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix
Since fraud detection datasets are often highly imbalanced, special techniques such as resampling methods or class weighting are applied to improve model performance.
The final model helps in:
Early detection of suspicious transactions
Reducing financial risk
Improving banking security systems
Supporting real-time fraud monitoring
This project demonstrates practical implementation of machine learning in financial cybersecurity and highlights the importance of AI-driven decision-making in modern banking systems.
